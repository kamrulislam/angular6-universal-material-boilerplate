# DrivingSchool

This is a sample project that gives a starting point to start an **angular 6** application with server side rendering (using *angular-uiversal*) and material design (using *angular-material*).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0. It uses angular universal and material design as well.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To build for server side rendering (ssr), use the following command.

```bash
npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
